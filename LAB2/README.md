# **Lab 2**

Read the lab2.pdf to get more details on each part of the project.

This lab is done in assembly language.

# **Part 1**

In this part you will implement an ARM assembly language program that counts the longest string of 1’s in a word of data. 
For example, if the word of data is 0x103fe00f, then the required result is 9.

# **Part 2**

The same as part 1 but now inside a subroutine.

# **Part 3**

Write a new assembly language program that determines the following:

• Longest string of 1’s in a word of data.

• Longest string of 0’s in a word of data.

• Longest string of alternating 1’s and 0’s in a word of data.

# **Part 4**

Extend part 3 so that the results are shown on the 7-segment displays in the FPGA.
