# **Lab 8**

Read the lab8.pdf to get more details on each part of the project.

This lab is done in C language.

# **Part 1**

In this part you will learn how to implement a simple line-drawing algorithm.

# **Part 2**

Write a C-language program that moves a horizontal line up and down on the screen and “bounces”
the line off the top and bottom edges of the display. Your program should first clear the screen and
draw the line at a starting row on the screen. Then, in an endless loop you should erase the line (by
drawing the line using black), and redraw it one row above or below the last one. When the line
reaches the top, or bottom, of the screen it should start moving in the opposite direction.

# **Part 3**
You are to create an animation of eight small filled rectangles on the screen. These rectangles should appear
to be moving continuously and “bouncing” off the edges of the screen. The rectangles should be connected
with lines to form a chain.

# **Part 4**

For this part of the exercise you are to enhance the animation from Part III so that during the animation the
following changes can take place:
1. The speed of movement of the rectangles can increased or decreased
2. The number of rectangles can be increased or decreased
3. The lines between rectangles can be drawn or not drawn
