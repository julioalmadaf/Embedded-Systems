# **Lab 6**

Read the lab6.pdf to get more details on each part of the project.

This lab is done in C language.

# **Part 1**

Write a C-language program that finds the largest number in a list of 32-bit integers that is stored in the memory.

# **Part 2**

Modify the code in Part 1 so that your program displays the result on the red leds, instead of using printf statement.

# **Part 3**

Check a list of data words for the longest strings of 1's, the longest strings of 0's, and the longest strings of 1's and 0's, show the result on the seven segments display. 

# **Part 4**

In this part of the exercise you are to write a C program that implements a real-time clock. Display the
clock-time on the 7-segment displays HEX5 − 0 in the format MM:SS:DD, where where MM are minutes,
SS are seconds, and DD are hundredths of a second. Measure time intervals of 0.01 seconds in your program
by using polled I/O with the A9 Private Timer. You should be able to stop/run the clock by pressing any
pushbutton KEY. When the clock reaches 59:59:99, it should wrap around to 00:00:00.

# **Part 4**

Write a C program that scrolls the message dE1-SoC in the right-to-left direction across the 7-segment
displays HEX5 − 0.You
should scroll the display at a rate of 0.2 seconds per character. You should be able to stop/run the scrolling
message by pressing any pushbutton KEY.
